                      a 5 star hotel. All bed linen is replaced and new towels are provided. Prior to your arrival, one of our trained staff then
                      undertake a full inventory and condition report. This step doubles up as quality control of housekeeping. Housekeeping is
                      recalled if any issues are identified. You will be emailed a copy of this fully detailed condition report, containing detailed
                      coloured photos for acknowledgement after you have settled in.
