                                            We suggest that once you have decided on your University, or have received your job offer, you should start looking for your furnished accommodation options. You should book the accommodation as early as possible, to ensure that you get your ideal furnished apartment and to take advantage of any early bird discounts. 
                                            However, we do take bookings all through the year, and are always happy to help you find your most suitable options.
