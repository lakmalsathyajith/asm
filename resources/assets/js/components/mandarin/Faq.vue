                          <p class="paraf-small">Apartment Stays Melbourne specialises in medium to long terms stays. Our average stay is in fact 7.2 months. By separating the cost of cleaning from the weekly rent, it enables those who stay longer to in fact pay much less on a weekly basis.</p>
                         <p class="paraf-small">For example. If the rent is $750 per week and the cost of cleaning, replacing all the linen and towels and resetting the apartment ready for the next guest is say $250, then the rent for one week realistically becomes $1,000. Still cheaper than a serviced apartment.</p>
                         <p class="paraf-small">However someone staying for 12 months or 52 weeks, the $250 equates to only $4.80 per week. So the weekly rent for this person is in fact only $754.80.</p>
                          <p class="paraf-small">So by splitting off the cost of the ‘re-set’ as a separate exit clean fee, we are in fact making our accommodation far more affordable for our long term guests.</p>

                           <p class="paraf-small"> Many people use the term ‘serviced apartments’ meaning short term furnished apartments. This is partly true in that they are furnished and are usually used for shorter stays, but this does not automatically mean that they are serviced. Serviced apartments in the strict sense means they are cleaned every day or every week. Generally, it is only serviced apartment chains who do the daily cleaning.</p> 
                            <p class="paraf-small">A self-catering apartment is a fully furnished apartment available for either short, medium or long term stays.Self-catering means the apartments don’t have daily or weekly cleans and therefore enjoy a much lower tariffs than similar quality serviced apartments.</p>
                            <p class="paraf-small">Self-Catering Apartments are otherwise pretty much the same as a serviced apartments. Apartment Stays Melbourne furnished apartments are generally much larger than most serviced apartments.</p>
                            <p class="paraf-small">Whilst our furnished apartments are self-catering apartments, for an additional charge, guests have the option to book weekly, fortnightly, monthly or periodic housekeeping which includes a full clean of the entire apartment as well as a change over of all linen and towels.</p>
                            <p class="paraf-small">Self- Catering Apartments usually charge an exit clean fee separately to significantly reduce the weekly rate for those guests staying medium to long term.</p>
